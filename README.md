## About the Video Course

AngularJS helps you build dynamic web apps quickly and easily. If you are looking for scalability and modularity in your apps, then AngularJS is the technology for you. It provides you with all the tools necessary to develop apps that are both attractive and functional.

This video course will show you how to write a complex application using AngularJS, one step at a time.

You will begin with preparing the system by setting up the necessary prerequisites. Then you will scaffold your application and write your first controllers and views using data binding to stitch them together. You will then move on to implementing your own custom services as well as directives to make your app flexible and extensible. Finally, you will turn your attention to testing the code before the course ends and you are ready to write your own Angular application.

You will start with an empty slate but by the end of the course, creating and implementing complex AngularJS applications will be easier than ever.
